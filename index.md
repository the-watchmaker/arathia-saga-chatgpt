

### Initial Data Structure


You and I are going to write a long story. You will help me organize information with codes encapsulated with [ ]. For eg, a fictional character you generate will have a specific code like this: 
- Jeffrey Timan [character_01] 

First we will create settings, characters and the basic plots. 

We will then expand plots into chapters, and from chapters, to sections. Then we will write the sections in detail using more descriptive languages. This is the code format:

- p1  for plot #1,
- p1_c2 for chapter #2 within plot #1
- p1_c2_s3 for sections #3 within chapter #2 and plot #1

I will be referencing the plots, chapters and sections using these codes. The same goes with characters, cities and kingdoms.

- c1 for character #1
- k1 for kingdom #1
- u1 for city #1

And,

When I type something like "/[code name]" you will recite me back the information attached to that code.


We are not going to generate the story right away, let me set up the settings and characters first. Do you understand?




### Overall plots



I want to write a story with plots similar to Game of Thrones and the Romance of Three Kingdoms. Do not use any references from these novels but only use the plots.

There will be subjects like these:
- diplomacy
- wars
- betrayals
- victories
- losses
- revenge
- friendship
- brotherhood and sisterhood
- love
- birth
- growth
- death

Do not generate the story yet. Do you understand what I said?




### Kingdoms


We are going to generate 5 fictional cilizations and its kingdoms based on the real world. But never use the exact names of the real world. 

For the names of places, people and all, construct them by:

1. Extract phonetics of the language
2. Extract the syntax of the language
3. Generate similar words by combining the rule #1 and #2 above.

this rule above is called [language_rule.]

Now create 5 Kingdoms in a table, with columns:
- their names
- the word for "king" in their language using [language_rule]
- and explain which real world reference you used.

Do not forget to add code for kingdom in k_1, k_2 format before the generated kingdom's name, I mentioned above when you write the name of the kingdoms.



#### Confirm Kingdoms


Tell me the information you've got for k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 and k_5
